Originally, the Linux kernel documentation contained a file named "ifenslave.c"
which could be used to add/remove slaves from a bonding master. However, this
tool has very little features, and what it does can also be done much simpler
by writing the names of interfaces to enslave to
/sys/class/net/$master/bonding/slaves. Therefore, the binary has now been
replaced by a shell script which accepts the same options as the original
binary.
