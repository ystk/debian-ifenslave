Description: configure network interfaces for parallel routing (bonding)
 This is a tool to attach and detach slave network interfaces to a bonding
 device. A bonding device will act like a normal Ethernet network device to
 the kernel, but will send out the packets via the slave devices using a simple
 round-robin scheduler. This allows for simple load-balancing, identical to
 "channel bonding" or "trunking" techniques used in switches.
 .
 The kernel must have support for bonding devices for ifenslave to be useful.
 This package supports 2.6.x kernels and the recent 3.x.x kernels.
